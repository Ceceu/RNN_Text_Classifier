#### Multi-Class Text Classification with LSTM

This repo aims to provide an example of how a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) like Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) 
architecture can be implemented using Tensorflow 2.

#### Requirements

This project was implemented in built-in Python 3 installation on Linux and all dependencies are in the `requirements.txt`.




#### Quick Run

```
# clone this repo
git clone git@github.com:Ceceu/RNN_Text_Classifier.git

# enter the project folder
cd RNN_Text_Classifier

# instantiate a virtual env (make sure python3-venv is availabe on you system)
python3 -m venv venv

# activate the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# install requirements
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# run on a simple dataset using sample configs (sample_configs.json)
python3 app.py
```
